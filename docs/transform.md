# Transform & Keyframes

## Properties

`x`, `y`, `scale`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` — editable in the properties sidebar and via preview handles.

## Keyframe Workflow

- Click the diamond icon next to a property to add/remove a keyframe at the current playhead time.
- **Key All** adds keyframes for every transform property at once.
- **Reset** clears all transforms and keyframes.

## Keyframe States

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Empty diamond | No keyframe at current time |
| Filled diamond | Keyframe exists at current time |
| Outlined diamond | Keyframes exist at other times |

## Easing

Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Ease In-Out — set per keyframe, applies to the transition toward the next keyframe.

## Keyframe Editor

Keyframes are grouped by timestamp. Each entry shows editable time, value, easing selector, and a delete button. Marker lines appear on the timeline clip.
