# Timeline

## Tracks

Add/remove freely (minimum 1). Clips on higher tracks render on top in the preview.

## Clip Placement

Drag from the media sidebar or double-click a media item. Move clips by dragging horizontally (time) and vertically (track). Overlap on the same track is prevented.

## Trimming

Drag clip edges. Video/audio trims adjust `trimStart`/`trimEnd` within source duration; images and components resize freely.

## Auto-Snap

Toggleable. Snaps clip edges to the playhead, other clip boundaries, and track start (10 px threshold).

## Ripple Edit

Toggleable. Deleting a clip shifts subsequent clips on the same track to the left by the deleted clip's duration.

## Zoom

20–300 %, adjustable via slider or +/− buttons. Ruler time intervals adapt automatically.

## Editing Shortcuts
